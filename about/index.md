# About GeoFracker

Geographical + Data Fracking => GeoFracker

Fracking can be [new way to extract gas from rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing) or [Battlestar Galactica favorite cursing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frak_(expletive)).

The idea here is very simple:  To explore `data fracking`, process which we get files with data and try to extract insights from it.

The main part of this blog will cover experiences with [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and data from [Sao Paulo](http://geosampa.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/PaginasPublicas/_SBC.aspx#), but it can be extended for several uses.


Good luck data fracking!!
